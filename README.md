2. **Insertion Sort**
   - Language: [Python](insertion_sort/insertion_sort.py), [Java](insertion_sort/InsertionSort.java), [C](insertion_sort/insertion_sort.c)

3. **Selection Sort**
   - Language: [Python](selection_sort/selection_sort.py), [Java](selection_sort/SelectionSort.java), [C](selection_sort/selection_sort.c)

4. **Merge Sort**

5. **Quick Sort**
   - Language: [Python](quick_sort/quick_sort.py), [Java](quick_sort/java/QuickSort.java), [C](quick_sort/c/quick_sort.c)

6. **Heap Sort**
   - Language: [Python](heap_sort/python/heap_sort.py), [Java](heap_sort/java/HeapSort.java), [C](heap_sort/c/heap_sort.c)

7. **Radix Sort**

## How to Contribute

Contributions are highly encouraged! If you have a sorting algorithm you'd like to add to this repository, or if you want to improve existing code, please follow these steps:

1. **Fork the repository**: Click the "Fork" button on the top right of this page. This creates a copy of the repository in your GitHub account.

2. **Clone your fork**: Clone your fork to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/anshjain722/sorting-algorithms.git
   ```

3. **Create a new branch**: Create a new branch for your sorting algorithm or improvement:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-sorting-algorithm
   ```

4. **Add your code**: Write clear and well-documented code for your sorting algorithm. Place it in the appropriate language-specific directory (e.g., `c/your_sorting_algorithm.c`).

5. **Update the README**: If you added a new sorting algorithm, make sure to update the README with information about your algorithm. Add a brief description, the language it's implemented in, and a link to the code.

6. **Commit your changes**: Commit your changes with a clear message:

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add [Your Sorting Algorithm] in [Language]"
   ```

7. **Push your changes**: Push your changes to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-sorting-algorithm
   ```

8. **Open a pull request (PR)**: Go to the [original repository](https://github.com/anshjain722/Sorting-Algorithms/) and click on the "New Pull Request" button. Provide a clear title and description for your pull request.

### That's it! Your contribution will be reviewed, and if everything looks good, it will be merged into the main repository.
